<h1>Welcome</h1>
Feel free to browse my Projects!
<p>
    All Projects are under MIT license so you are free to tinker with them.<br>
    Most projects are written in Java but I am recently started using more and more Kotlin.<br>
</p>
<p>
    There are also few C projects as I am trying to learn it.<br>
    All of them only run/compile on a Linux/Unix machine as I have little interest in coding for Windows.<br>
    I am compiling with clang instead of gcc and using C11 standard.

<p>
    Viola and Homefy are my biggest projects.<br>
    Both are Music players: Viola for Linux and Homefy for Android.<br>
    Viola plays local music and Homefy is Spotify like music streaming app with Node based server backend.
